The dashboard page is located under the Project -> Network -> Network Topology
page, where you can view a graphical representation of the interaction of your
routers, networks, and instances.

Viewing Network Topology
------------------------

Once you have logged into the DreamCompute dashboard, click the **Network
Topology** tab in the left-hand panel under Project -> Network.

You can select the small view by clicking the **SMALL** button at the top
left which displays a basic view of your DreamCompute setup where:

* Routers and instances are shown as small boxes
* Networks are shown as labeled vertical lines
* Connections between networks/routers and the public internet (public-110 in
  this example) are shown as horizontal lines.

Normal View
-----------

You can select the normal view by clicking the **NORMAL** button at the top
left which is similar to the small view except it shows more details,
including:

* IP addresses are shown next to the associated routers and instances, and
* larger boxes representing the routers and instances show the type and name
  displayed inside.

Other Features
--------------

The Network Topology page also contains buttons on the upper right which open
other parts of the DreamCompute dashboard, including:

* Launch Instance -- opens the **Instances** page,
* Create Network -- opens the **Networks** page, and
* Create Router -- opens the **Routers** page.

If you hover your mouse over an router or instance, you can see additional
details with additional management shortcuts.
