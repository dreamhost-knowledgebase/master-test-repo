<div class="section" id="trellis">
<h2>Trellis</h2>
<p>In this tutorial we are going to use <a class="reference external" href="https://roots.io/trellis/">Trellis</a>
to install a very solid modern LEMP stack on DreamCompute. This LEMP stack by
Roots is great to run WordPress websites and works well with <a class="reference external" href="https://roots.io/bedrock/">Bedrock</a>
, the modern WordPress stack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="modern-lemp-stack">
<h2>Modern LEMP Stack</h2>
<p>Trellis is a set of Ansible playbooks that help you setup a full local,
staging and development environment for your WordPress project. With it you
will have a WordPress ready server running locally or remotely (intention
in this tutorial) with:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Nginx</li>
<li>MariaDB (MySQL drop-in replacement)</li>
<li>PHP 7 (+ extensions)</li>
<li>Composer</li>
<li>WP-CLI</li>
<li>sSMTP</li>
<li>Memcached</li>
<li>Fail2ban</li>
<li>ferm (firewall)</li>
<li>Mailhog</li>
</ul>
<p>Locally it works with an automated Vagrant setup and remotely for staging
it sets you up with a fully fledged WordPress server. It also helps you
deploy your WordPress site once you are ready to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>There are several <a class="reference external" href="https://roots.io/trellis/docs/installing-trellis/">requirements</a>
to work with Trellis locally and to be able to work on the remote server:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ansible 2.0.2.0</li>
<li>Virtualbox &gt;= 4.3.10</li>
<li>Vagrant &gt;= 1.5.4</li>
<li>vagrant-bindfs &gt;= 0.3.1 (Windows users may skip this if not using vagrant-winnfsd for folder sync)</li>
<li>vagrant-hostmanager</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p>Ansible is both needed for setting up a remote server for staging or
production on DreamCompute. Git and an accessible online repository will also be
needed as well as the latest Python 2.x version for running Ansible 2.0.2.0.</p>
<p>On Ubuntu most if not all of these tools can be installed using the
package manager apt-get. On OSX Homebrew and Pip are your friends. On
Windows more Linux tools have become available with the latest version
such as Bash and other needed dependencies can be installed as well using
various tools. Tougher though than on Nix systems as you can read <a class="reference external" href="https://roots.io/trellis/docs/windows/">here</a> .</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trellis-setup">
<h2>Trellis Setup</h2>
<p><strong>NB</strong> Taken from <a class="reference external" href="https://roots.io/trellis/docs/installing-trellis/">Roots Trellis documentation on installing Trellis</a></p>
<p>Structure as recommended by Roots is</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>example.com/      # → Root folder for the project
├── trellis/      # → Your clone of this repository
└── site/         # → A Bedrock-based WordPress site
    └── web/
        ├── app/  # → WordPress content directory (themes, plugins, etc.)
        └── wp/   # → WordPress core (don&#39;t touch!)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Set up a directory for your project:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ mkdir example.com &amp;&amp; cd example.com
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then clone the repository:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:roots/trellis.git &amp;&amp; rm -rf trellis/.git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Clone Bedrock:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:roots/bedrock.git site &amp;&amp; rm -rf site/.git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Install the Galaxy Ansible Roles</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cd trellis &amp;&amp; ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next you need to change the wordpress_sites.yml. File for local
development is to be found at trellis/group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml
wordpress_sites:
  example.com:
    site_hosts:
      - example.dev
    local_path: ../site # path targeting local Bedrock site directory
    (relative to Ansible root)
    admin_email: admin@example.dev
    multisite:
      enabled: false
    ssl:
      enabled: false
    cache:
      enabled: false
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You also need to edit vault.yml for local development:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#  group_vars/development/vault.yml
    vault_wordpress_sites:
      example.com:
        admin_password: admin
        env:
          db_password: example_dbpassword
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This file contains all the database data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="local-setup">
<h2>Local Setup</h2>
<p>How you install things locally depends partly on your operating system:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>OSX,</li>
<li>Linux,</li>
<li>Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>and is not really part of this tutorial as we focus on the
DreamCompute part of things. I recommend following the Trellis
documentation on the <a class="reference external" href="https://roots.io/trellis/docs/local-development-setup/">local development setup</a>
. Just remember the earlier mentioned prerequisites. Without those on your
local server or PC you won&#8217;t be able to get things started. This and the
proper changes in the Trellis configuration files for setting up a site
locally and remotely the way you want. See documentation on this at <a class="reference external" href="https://roots.io/trellis/docs/wordpress-sites/">Roots
Trellis Docs WordPress Sites</a> .</p>
<p>Just make sure you have checked the following items:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Configure your site(s) based on the WordPress Sites docs.</li>
<li>Read the <a class="reference external" href="https://roots.io/trellis/docs/wordpress-sites/#development">development specific ones</a></li>
<li>Make sure you&#8217;ve edited both group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml and</li>
<li>edited group_vars/development/vault.yml.</li>
</ul>
<p>They were discussed under installation earlier!</p>
<p>Then run the vagrant command from the command line. Do this inside the
trellis folder where the Vagrant File is:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>vagrant up
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h3>Bedrock</h3>
<p>For working with Bedrock - a Modern WordPress Stack - which is really
recommended we recommend you checking out the <a class="reference external" href="https://roots.io/bedrock/">Bedrock documentation</a> . Just great to have a WordPress Stack with a
logical file structure, dependency management with Composer, easy WordPress
configuration and enhanced security!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-up-your-instance">
<h2>Setting Up Your Instance</h2>
<p>Go to your DreamCompute Dashboard and pick Ubuntu from the list under
images. This Trellis server setup on a DreamCompute instance is best done
using a Ubuntu 14.0.4 image on DreamCompute. You can also use a more
recent version of Ubuntu, Ubuntu 16.0.4. However, you will then be
forced to install an older version of Python - 2.x - side by side
with Python 3 on your DreamCompute instance. This you can do using:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-get install python
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you do not mind this extra step then do go ahead. Always nice to run a
more recent Ubuntu version, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Just make sure you use Ubuntu as the Ansible playbooks used by Trellis to
run the LEMP setup are built with Ubuntu/Debian in mind.
Whichever Ubuntu version you pick, remember it&#8217;s better to boot volume
backed instances as they are permanent as opposed to ephemeral disks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="provisioning-your-dreamcompute-instance">
<h2>Provisioning Your DreamCompute Instance</h2>
<p>Provisioning Trellis means setting up the actual LEMP stack for your
staging or production website. Staging and Production do not differ much.
Do remember you need a separate instance for both though!
<strong>NB</strong> Provisioning you normally do once you have worked out the proper
site setup and have setup things locally.</p>
<div class="section" id="passwordless-ssh">
<h3>Passwordless SSH</h3>
<p>Trellis works best with passwordless SSH login so do make sure you have
added your public SSH key in the DreamCompute Dashboard.</p>
<p>DreamCompute allows you to add your key in the DC Dashboard under Access &amp;
Security &gt; Key Pairs.</p>
<p>Also make sure the file trellis/group_vars/all/users.yml has the proper
path to you SSH key on your box and that that is the one you added to the
DreamCompute Dashboard.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuration-files">
<h2>Configuration Files</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you work locally and on production only and have worked out
things locally. Then you only need to set up / edit a couple of files for
provisioning your remote server - <a class="reference external" href="https://roots.io/trellis/docs/remote-server-setup/">setting up remote server documentation</a>
<strong>NB</strong> You can most of the time just copy data from the local development files.</p>
<div class="section" id="wordpress-sites">
<h3>WordPress Sites</h3>
<p>The first one to begin with is wordpress_sites.yml. This file is located
under trellis/group_vars/production. In this file you need to change the
following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>name of site</li>
<li>site_hosts</li>
<li>repository (Github repository for example)</li>
<li>multisite or not</li>
<li>ssl or not and which provider</li>
<li>cache enabled or not</li>
</ul>
<p>This is basically the same for setting things up locally so if you did that
well, this should work out just fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vault">
<h3>Vault</h3>
<p>Once that is done you also need to edit vault.yml - extended documentation
at <a class="reference external" href="https://roots.io/trellis/docs/vault/">https://roots.io/trellis/docs/vault/</a> under trellis/group_vars/production
. There you have to add:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>vault_mysql_root_password</li>
<li>vault_wordpress_sites (same as in wordpress_sites.yml)</li>
<li>db_password</li>
<li>auth_key</li>
<li>secure_auth_key</li>
<li>logged_in_key</li>
<li>nonce_key</li>
<li>auth_salt</li>
<li>secure_auth_salt</li>
<li>logged_in_salt</li>
<li>nonce_salt</li>
</ul>
<p>Generate your keys at the Roots <a class="reference external" href="https://roots.io/salts.html">salts generator</a> .</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hosts">
<h3>Hosts</h3>
<p>Now under the trellis folder open hosts/production. That is a file where
you add your host details for making the real connection. If you do forget
it you will net be able to connect and sometimes not get any errors at all
. Here is an example:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Add each host to the [production] group and to a &quot;type&quot; group such as
 [web] or [db].
# List each machine only once per [group], even if it will host
multiple sites.

[production]
example.com

[web]
example.com
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can either add the domain connected to the DreamCompute public IP
address using an A record or use the IP address itself. Better connect the
domain to your instance before you provision. See this <a class="reference external" href="https://goo.gl/vYHa1h">DreamHost KB
article on Custom DNS Records</a> .</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="users">
<h3>Users</h3>
<p>Wait, we skipped one more important file to attend to located in
trellis/group_vars/all. That is users.yml. DreamCompute does not work with
root but with the user dhc-user and that should be reflected in this file:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Documentation: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/ssh-keys/
admin_user: dhc-user
# Also define &#39;vault_sudoer_passwords&#39; (`group_vars/staging/vault.yml`,
 `group_vars/production/vault.yml`)
users:
  - name: &quot;{{ web_user }}&quot;
    groups:
      - &quot;{{ web_group }}&quot;
    keys:
      - &quot;{{ lookup(&#39;file&#39;, &#39;~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub&#39;) }}&quot;
      # - https://github.com/username.keys
  - name: &quot;{{ admin_user }}&quot;
    groups:
      - sudo
    keys:
      - &quot;{{ lookup(&#39;file&#39;, &#39;~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub&#39;) }}&quot;
      # - https://github.com/username.keys
web_user: web
web_group: www-data
web_sudoers:
  - &quot;/usr/sbin/service php7.0-fpm *&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Everything else in this file can stay the same. Do notice where it is
grabbing the SSH keys from. If you have keys with a different name or
located elsewhere you do need to change those lines as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="push-to-remote-dreamcompute-instance">
<h3>Push to Remote DreamCompute Instance</h3>
<p>Double check you have done the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Configure your WordPress sites in group_vars/&lt;environment&gt;/wordpress_sites.yml</li>
<li>configure all in in group_vars/&lt;environment&gt;/vault.yml (see the Vault docs for how to encrypt files containing passwords)</li>
<li>Add your server IP/hostnames to hosts/&lt;environment&gt;</li>
<li>Specify public SSH keys for users in group_vars/all/users.yml (see the SSH Keys docs)</li>
</ul>
<p>When all that is good you can go ahead and push to the remote server using:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ansible-playbook server.yml -e env=&lt;environment&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here <em>environment</em> will be production if you are pushing to production.
Staging is the other option.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Please understand that provisioning will take quite some time as
a full stack server will be installed with Nginx, MariaDB, PHP 7 and
beautiful things such as SSL, HTTP2 and so on. Also it takes care of
setting up WordPress on the server. All in all a pretty great feat.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deploying-your-site-to-dreamcompute">
<h2>Deploying your site to DreamCompute</h2>
<p>You have to realize that provisioning is just setting up your server for
working with WordPress really well and at lightning speed. The instance is
still not loading a site at all and going to the IP address or domain will
show you a nice Nginx 404 as nothing can be found. You simply need to
push your locally deployed WordPress site to the server still. Once that
is done you still either have to go through the installation process or
import and existing database.</p>
<p>For deploys, there are a couple more settings needed besides the ones you
did for provisioning:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>repository (required) - git URL of your Bedrock-based WordPress project (in SSH format: <a class="reference external" href="mailto:git&#37;&#52;&#48;github&#46;com">git<span>&#64;</span>github<span>&#46;</span>com</a>:roots/bedrock.git)</li>
<li>repo_subtree_path (optional) - relative path to your Bedrock/WP directory in your repository if its not the root (like site in roots-example-project)</li>
<li>branch (optional) - the git branch to deploy (default: master)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can deploy with a single command:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>./deploy.sh &lt;environment&gt; &lt;domain&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where the environment can again be staging or production .</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>
Make sure you have SSH Agent forwarding set up properly. Read more on it
at the <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.github.com/guides/using-ssh-agent-forwarding/">Using SSH Agent Forwarding</a> article
