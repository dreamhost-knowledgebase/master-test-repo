How to Use ownCloud with DreamObjects
=====================================

Overview
~~~~~~~~

`ownCloud <http://owncloud.org>`_ is a free and open source file hosting
application that provides universal file access, synchronization, and sharing
of your data using a single interface regardless of where the data is located.
You can access, sync, and share nearly anything such as contacts, calendars,
bookmarks, and backups inside ownCloud via the web, your computer, or mobile
devices.

Since version 6.0, ownCloud allows you to use DreamObjects as an external
storage option, which gives you total freedom and control over your data.

This guide describes how to set up ownCloud to connect to DreamHost's
DreamObjects cloud storage service.

Setting up ownCloud with DreamObjects
-------------------------------------

The following describes how to connect ownCloud with DreamObjects using an
access key, secret key, and bucket name.

To locate and copy your access keys, please see:

* `Copying your access keys`_

    .. figure:: images/12_owncloud_with_DreamObjects.fw.png

.. note::

    Your bucket name cannot contain an underscore as ownCloud will fail
    to connect.

1. Scroll down to the External Storage section.

    .. figure:: images/13_owncloud_with_DreamObjects.fw.png

2. Enter objects-us-west-1.dream.io into the DreamObjects hostname field.
    * You'll see a green icon indicating the connection once you enter the
      hostname.
    * You can leave the fields empty for port and region.

    * If you have multiple users of your ownCloud installation, you can limit
      who has access to the folder using the 'Available For' section to the
      right of the configuration information.

    .. figure:: images/17_owncloud_with_DreamObjects.fw.png

    * To see your files, navigate back to the 'Files' section by clicking on
      the 'Apps' drop down menu in the upper left and then clicking on
      'Files'. You'll now see the folder name you specified in the Files
      section.

    .. figure:: images/18_owncloud_with_DreamObjects.fw.png

    * Clicking on this folder will show you the data in your DreamObjects
      bucket linked to ownCloud. Anything you keep, upload, or create there is
      stored in DreamObjects. Deleting an object inside ownCloud will remove
      the object from DreamObjects.
    * If you wish to connect additional buckets, simply create a new folder
      and connect this bucket to the folder via the 'Admin > External Storage'
      section of the ownCloud panel. You can connect as many buckets as you'd
      wish with ownCloud.

Uploading large files inside ownCloud to DreamObjects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you plan to upload large files to DreamObjects using ownCloud, you'll need
to be aware of some limitations and make some configuration changes since
uploading large files can be very memory intensive.

A Web VPS with at least 512MB of memory is recommended, and required for
extremely large file sizes. DreamObjects' objects are limited to 10TBs in
size, but must be uploaded in 5GB chunks. ownCloud does not support multi-part
file uploads so you are limited to 5GB file uploads via ownCloud.

ownCloud uses an .htaccess file located in the ownCloud folder on the server
to set the following custom PHP parameters:

.. code::

    php_value upload_max_filesize 513M
    php_value post_max_size 513M
    php_value memory_limit 512M
    php_value mbstring.func_overload 0
    php_value always_populate_raw_post_data -1

If you intend to upload files larger than 513M, it's suggested that the domain
is configured to use the latest PHP version. You’ll also need to create custom
PHP settings to set the desired upload size, execution time, and increased PHP
memory usage.
