a password before they're uploaded so your data is protected.

        When launching Arq for the first time, you are prompted to
        choose your backup destination type.  Click the 'Other
        S3-Compatible Service' option, and then click **continue**.

2. Enter DreamObject's hostname:

        For the S3-Compatible Server URL, enter the hostname
        'https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io'. Next ensure that the
        signature version defaults to 'Signature Version 2', and then
        fill in the access and secret keys with the values from the
        DreamHost panel.  Click **continue** to advance to the next
        step.  Read how to find your `DreamObjects Keys`_.

3. Enter a bucket name:

    .. figure:: images/Arq-3-win.png

        Arq will prompt you to enter a new bucket name, or select an
        existing bucket.  Choose the option you want and enter a name
        if necessary, then click **Add** to complete.

4. Set up backups:

    .. figure:: images/Arq-4-win.png

        After your bucket is configured, Arq will ask if you want to
        setup a new backup schedule, or to restore files from this
        bucket (which requires existing backups in your bucket).  Click
        **Set Up Backups**.

5. Encrypt backups:

    .. figure:: images/Arq-5-win.png

        Create an encrypted password for your backup which allows
        additional security for the backup created.

6. Store the encryption password:

    .. figure:: images/Arq-6-win.png

        After you enter an encrypted password, be sure to write down
        the password you created and store it somewhere safe.

7. Choose the folders to backup:

    .. figure:: images/Arq-7-win.png

        On Windows systems, Arq defaults to backing up the entire C:
        drive excluding only the Recycle Bin and the pagefile.sys file.

8. Edit backup suggestions:

    .. figure:: images/Arq-8-win.png

        To add or remove files or folders, click the **Edit backup
        suggestions** button, which will allow you to customize the
        selection.

Arq is now configured to backup your data.
