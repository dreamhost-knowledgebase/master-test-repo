`GoodSync <http://www.goodsync.com/>`_ is an easy, secure, and
reliable file synchronizer. The free version is limited to 3 jobs or
less and 100 or less files and folders in each job. Pricing is $29.95
for the Windows version, and $39.95 for the Mac version.

   .. note::  Many customers have reported issues with GoodSync
              failing with files larger than 100MB.
              Until a solution is found, it’s recommend that you use another
              client.
