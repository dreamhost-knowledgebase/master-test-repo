How to Use Dropshare with DreamObjects
=======================================

Overview
~~~~~~~~

`Dropshare <https://getdropsha.re>`_ is a so-called menulet for OS X that
enables you to easily drag&drop files, folders and anything else to your own
server, DreamObjects, or other cloud services. Once uploaded, the app copies
the link to the file to your Mac's clipboard and you're ready to share with
anyone you like!

Before you begin, you'll need to create a `bucket`_ on the
`(Panel > 'Cloud Services' > DreamObjects'
<https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.objects&>`_) page.
