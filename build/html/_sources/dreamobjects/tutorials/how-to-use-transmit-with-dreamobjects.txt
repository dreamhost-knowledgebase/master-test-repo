developed by Panic which also includes capabilities to mount SFTP, Amazon S3,
and WebDAV connections. The client is a shareware so it's free to evaluate but
after the trial period is over youâ€™re limited to seven-minute sessions.

This guide describes how to use Transmit to mount your DreamObjects buckets.
